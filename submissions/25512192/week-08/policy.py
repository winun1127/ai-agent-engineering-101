"""The policy: every number the shop and the buyer act on, in one file the strategist rewrites.

state/policy.json holds the current policy; load() always returns a complete, clamped one, so a missing
file, a half-written answer or a strategist that asks for something silly never reaches a deal.
The code (seller, restock, buyer) reads the policy; only strategist.py writes it.
