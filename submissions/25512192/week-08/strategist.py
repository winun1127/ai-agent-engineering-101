"""The strategist: a meta-harness. A stronger model reads what happened and rewrites the policy.

    python strategist.py                 # run once now
    python strategist.py --if-older 1800 # run only when the policy is older than 30 minutes (restock calls this)

Every deal is negotiated by haiku with the numbers in state/policy.json. Every STRATEGY_EVERY seconds this
script hands sonnet one page of evidence (the ledger stats, our stock, our sales, our buyer's payments and
breakages) and the current policy, and asks for a new policy with a reason per change. policy.clamp() keeps
the answer inside safe bounds; every run is appended to state/policy_history.jsonl, so the history of the
strategy is itself a log.

PROMPT = """The market: shops buy stock from the market (cost: grade A 55-75%, B 40-60%, C 25-45% of list price),
then sell it to buyer agents who negotiate. Food loses grade while it waits and is thrown away at its date.
Goods in stock cost 1% of cost per day; some goods break within 6 h of the sale, and a warranty then refunds the
buyer from the shop. Our shop is ranked by 0.5 profit + 0.3 revenue + 0.2 stars; our buyer by 0.5 surplus

EVIDENCE
{evidence}

CURRENT POLICY
{policy}

What each field does:
shop.open_ratio: opening ask / list price. shop.floor_margin: lowest price = cost x (1 + this).
shop.clearance_hours / clearance_floor: food with fewer hours left may go down to cost x clearance_floor.
shop.warranty_hours: warranty offered per goods grade (0-6). shop.stock_categories: up to 8 categories to stock
(exact names from the evidence; empty = the ledger's best sellers). shop.units_per_sku, shop.max_stock_share,
shop.food_min_shelf_hours: how much and what to stock.
buyer.offer_open_ratio: first offer / list. buyer.max_paid_ratio: the most the buyer pays / list.
buyer.goods_grades, buyer.require_warranty_goods, buyer.food_hours_margin: what the buyer accepts before paying.

Change only what the evidence supports; small steps. Answer with the full new policy:
{{"shop": {{...}}, "buyer": {{...}}, "notes": "<one paragraph: what you changed and the evidence for it>"}}"""
